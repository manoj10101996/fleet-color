### Color Data (JSON)

As am interested in color's I have already gathered color data and had it in hand to use now with the current requirement.

### Services - Node packages

No packages used.

### Presentation - color

To represent color as background and showing the font name in a card am using Contrast checking script which i had earlier with use of this am showing text color based on appropriate background color.

### Routes

You can directly access the application by going root path of the URL.

### How it works

As per gathered color data there is more than 18000+ entries so keeping a search with less than 2 characters will result it performance issue.

So to reduce the work load have a thresold of minimum 3 characters needed to filter the colors by name.

### Component created

Color-fleet - Component
Color-tool - service
COLORS - Color Data
